# Retail-Sales-Performance-Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive retail sales dashboard built in Microsoft Excel (Web version).
The objective of the dashboard is to analyze business performance using transactional sales data and provide insights into revenue generation, profitability, product demand, and geographic performance.

The dataset contains **9,648 transaction records** from a footwear and apparel retailer.
Each record represents a sales transaction including product type, location, sales channel, and profit information.

The dashboard allows users to filter and explore the data dynamically using slicers and pivot charts.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

The following business metrics were used:

* Total Revenue (Total Sales)
* Operating Profit
* Units Sold
* Operating Margin

---

## Key Insights

* Footwear products generate significantly higher revenue than apparel.
* Men's footwear categories contribute the largest share of sales and profit.
* In-store sales produce higher revenue compared to outlet sales.
* Certain states and cities dominate overall company performance.
* Some locations show high sales but lower profitability, indicating higher operational costs or discounting.

---

## Limitations

* Time-series analysis (monthly or yearly trends) was not included because the Excel web version could not properly convert text dates into date format.
* The analysis focuses on categorical and geographic performance rather than seasonal trends.

---

## Conclusion

The dashboard provides a clear overview of business performance and allows decision-makers to identify:

* Best-selling products
* Most profitable categories
* Strong geographic markets
* Effective sales channels

The project demonstrates how Excel pivot tables, slicers, and charts can be used to build an interactive business intelligence dashboard without advanced analytics software.
